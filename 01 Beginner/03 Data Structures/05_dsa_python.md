In addition to lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, Python offers several other data structures that are commonly used in various scenarios. Here are a few more notable data structures:

1. **Deque (Double-ended Queue)**:
   - A deque is a double-ended queue that supports adding and removing elements from both ends efficiently.
   - It is available in Python's `collections` module and is useful for scenarios requiring fast appends and pops from either end of the data structure.

   ```python
   from collections import deque

   dq = deque([1, 2, 3])
   dq.append(4)  # Adds 4 to the right end
   dq.appendleft(0)  # Adds 0 to the left end
   dq.pop()  # Removes and returns the rightmost element (4)
   dq.popleft()  # Removes and returns the leftmost element (0)
   ```

2. **Heapq (Heap Queue)**:
   - Python's `heapq` module provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, also known as the priority queue algorithm.
   - Heaps are binary trees that satisfy the heap property: parent nodes are smaller or larger than their children.

   ```python
   import heapq

   heap = [3, 2, 5, 1, 4]
   heapq.heapify(heap)  # Convert list into a heap
   heapq.heappush(heap, 0)  # Push item onto heap
   heapq.heappop(heap)  # Pop and return the smallest item from the heap
   ```

3. **OrderedDict**:
   - `OrderedDict` maintains the order of keys based on their insertion order, unlike a regular dictionary.
   - Useful for applications that require ordered iteration or tracking operations.

   ```python
   from collections import OrderedDict

   ordered_dict = OrderedDict()
   ordered_dict['a'] = 1
   ordered_dict['b'] = 2
   ordered_dict['c'] = 3
   ```

4. **DefaultDict**:
   - `DefaultDict` is a subclass of the built-in `dict` that provides a default value for a nonexistent key.
   - Useful for handling missing keys without raising a `KeyError`.

   ```python
   from collections import defaultdict

   d = defaultdict(int)
   d['a'] += 1  # No KeyError even if 'a' is not in the dictionary
   ```

5. **NamedTuple**:
   - `NamedTuple` creates tuple subclasses with named fields, enhancing readability and reducing code maintenance.
   - Provides both positional and named access to tuple elements.

   ```python
   from collections import namedtuple

   Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
   p = Point(1, 2)
   print(p.x, p.y)  # Output: 1 2
   ```

6. **ChainMap**:
   - `ChainMap` combines multiple dictionaries into a single mapping to search them as a unit.
   - Useful for managing configurations, providing defaults, and combining mappings logically.

   ```python
   from collections import ChainMap

   dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
   dict2 = {'c': 3, 'd': 4}
   combined_dict = ChainMap(dict1, dict2)
   ```

7. **Counter**:
   - `Counter` is a dictionary subclass for counting hashable objects. It's especially useful for counting occurrences of items.

   ```python
   from collections import Counter

   cnt = Counter([1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1])
   print(cnt)  # Output: Counter({1: 4, 2: 2, 3: 1})
   ```

These additional data structures offer specialized functionalities beyond basic lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, catering to various programming needs from efficient queue operations to ordered mapping and counting elements. Each structure has its unique features and use cases, making Python versatile in handling different types of data efficiently.
